// THE SERVICES FOLDER IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO CREATE ALL OF OUR LOGIC AROUND
// TALKING TO EXTERNAL SERVICES HAPPEN, WHETHER IT BE GOOGLE FIREABASE OR WHAT NOT
// SERVICES IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE SERVERS 
// the service file operate as a layer in between the context, the react native application and the external service provider like google.
// what we are doing is we are not taking API from google API called we aren't implmenting right now.
// There's way more that needs to go into that so what we are doing is we are faking it we are not integrating against google
// BUT WE ARE HAVING LOCAL FILES THAT HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S STRUCTURES IN THE SAME WAY THAT GOOGLE WOULD SEND THIS BACK INFORMATION BUT WHAT WE DOING IS WE ARE STORING THEM LOCALLY ON THE PHONE.
// AND THAT WAY WE CAN BUILD OUR IMPLEMENTATION AS IF WE ARE TALKING TO GOOGLE AND LATER ON 
// WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO TALK TO GOOGLE IT'S GOING TO BE A QUESTION OF JUST SWITCHING SOME THINGS AROUND, BECAUSE THE WAY THAT OUR APP UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY THERE.

// SINCE WE ARE USING REACT NATIVE WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE REACT CONTEXT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SERVICE FILE THAT'S GOING TO OPERATE AS AN INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN OUR APP AND THE EXTERNAL SERVICE.
// WE ARE GOING TO MOCK THE EXTERNAL SERVICE WE AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT AS IF THE EXTERNAL SERVICE IS REAL. AND TO DO THAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT THIS SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE SERVICE LAYER. AND FOR EVERY SUBSEQUEST FEATURE WE WILL BE USING SOMETHING SIMILAR RELATIVELY SIMILAR ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT CHANGED THINGS A BIT BASED ON THE SITUTATION.
